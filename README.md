# Photo-Bomb-Diffuser
CV project 
There is nothing more annoying than seeing something you don't want to see. As we take photos of loved ones, friends, or ourselves we create albums of fond memories; the good times in our lives. But we are not alone in this world; our fellow humans inhabit not only our space but also these prized possessions. Removing these so called photo bombers usually is done when a photo is taken; you wait for a clearing and then quickly snap-a-pic! What if you didn't have to wait; what if you could remove unwanted people from your background in an instant! No photo-shop required. In this project, the authors aim to make a "Magic Eraser" that can automatically detect individuals and remove them from photographs. We aim to achieve this by training and deploying a instance segmentation and neural in-painting deep learning model.
